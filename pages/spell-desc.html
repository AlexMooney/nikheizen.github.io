<pre><a name="wonder"></a><span class="hilight">Wonder</span> rolls 1d100 + (level / 5) then adds up to (25 + level / 2) if the player is a wild talent.
The Chance virtue also influences the results in a very minor fashion.
If the result is less than the following numbers, it has the listed effect:
    8: Clones the target monster. The clone has +10 speed and full health.
    14: Hastes the target monster.
    26: Heals the target monster by 4d6.
    31: Polymorphs the target monster.
    36: Bolt or beam which does (3 + (level - 1) / 5)d4 damage.
    41: Confuses the target monster.
    46: Ball which does (20 + (level / 2)) poison damage in 2 radius.
    51: Creates a beam of light which illuminates a line and does minor damage to light vulnerable monsters.
    56: Bolt or beam which does (3 + (level - 5) / 4)d8 lightning damage.
    61: Bolt or beam which does (3 + (level - 5) / 4)d8 cold damage.
    66: Bolt or beam which does (3 + (level - 5) / 4)d8 acid damage.
    71: Bolt or beam which does (3 + (level - 5) / 4)d8 fire damage.
    76: Bolt which does 75 damage to a living monster and heals you correspondingly.
    81: Ball which does (30 + (level / 2) lightning damage in 2 radius.
    86: Ball which does (40 + level) acid damage in 2 radius.
    91: Ball which does (70 + level) ice damage in 3 radius.
    96: Ball which does (80 + level) fire damage in 3 radius.
    101: Bolt which does (100 + level) damage to a living monster and heals you correspondingly.
    106: Destruction in radius 13-18 with power (level * 2)
    108: Genocide with power (50 + level).
    110: Does 120 untyped damage to every monster in line of sight.
Additionally, there are four bonus effects which have a very very low chance of happening without having high Chance virtue or being a wild talent.
If the die roll is 110 or higher, randomly choose one of the following effects:
    > Does 150 untyped damage to every monster in line of sight.
    > Attempts to slow every monster in line of sight with power (level).
    > Attenots to sleep every monster in line of sight with power (level).
    > Heals player for 300 HP.

<a name="call_chaos"></a><span class="hilight">Call Chaos</span> randomly chooses from the following damage types:
        GF_ELEC,          GF_POIS,         GF_ACID,    GF_COLD,
        GF_FIRE,          GF_MISSILE,      GF_ARROW,   GF_PLASMA,
        GF_HOLY_FIRE,     GF_WATER,        GF_LITE,    GF_DARK,
        GF_FORCE,         GF_INERT,        GF_MANA,    GF_METEOR,
        GF_ICE,           GF_CHAOS,        GF_NETHER,  GF_DISENCHANT,
        GF_SHARDS,        GF_SOUND,        GF_NEXUS,   GF_CONFUSION,
        GF_TIME,          GF_GRAVITY,      GF_ROCKET,  GF_NUKE,
        GF_HELL_FIRE,     GF_DISINTEGRATE, GF_PSY_SPEAR
Then proceeds through a number of checks as follows:
    1. There is a 1/4 chance to be a beam. If it is not a beam, it will be a ball.
    2. There is a 1/6 chance for the damage type to be rerolled to a type which shows up in the table after GF_HOLY_FIRE (starting with GF_ELEC and going through each row).
    <sup>[Note: not 100% sure this is how it works. This code is difficult to understand.]</sup>
        2a. If the previous check passed, then it does 1-150 damage. Ball radius is 2.
    3. If 2 did not trigger, there is a 1/3 chance to be a player-centered ball which does 1-500 damage in radius 8.
    4. If neither 2, nor 3 triggered, it does 1-250 damage. Ball radius is (3 + (level / 25)). 

<a name="call_the_void"></a><span class="hilight">Call the Void</span> checks if there are any adjacent, non-permanent walls. If there are none, it has the first effect, otherwise it has the second effect.
    > The first effect fires a different random one of the following in each of 8 directions from the player's position:
        > Rocket which does 175 shards damage in 2 radius.
        > Rocket which does 175 mana damage in 3 radius.
        > Rocket which does 175 radiation in 4 radius.
    > The second effect is Destruction in radius (15 + level + 0-11) with power (level * 8). Then take 1d150 + 100 damage.
        > There is a 1/666 chance of the Destruction effect not occuring, you will still take the damage though.

<a name="natures_wrath"></a><span class="hilight">Nature's Wrath</span>'s effects are randomly chosen from the following:
    > (4 * level + 1y) untyped damage in line of sight & Earthquake & ball which does (200 + (2 * level) + 2y) disintegration damage in (1 + level/12) radius.
    > Bolt which does (8 * level) lightning damage.
    > Ball which does (level * 5) sound damage in (1 + level/12) radius.
    > Ball which does (level * 4) gravity damage in (1 + level/12) radius.
    > 3 balls which each do (240 + level * 2 + 2y) of each lightning, fire, and cold, in (1 + level/12) radius. All balls strike the same area. 
    > Fires 1-3 balls which do (70 + level) shards damage in 1 radius. <sup>[Note: the code here is kind of hard to understand, please submit an issue if this is wrong]</sup>

<a name="shuffle"></a><span class="hilight">Shuffle</span> rolls 1d110 + (level / 5) if you are a rogue, high mage, or sorcerer (otherwise 1d120).
