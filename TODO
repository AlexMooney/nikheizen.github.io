Move non-auto-generated stuff out of inline html and into largely CSS

Pull text from plaintext files using tags where possible (mainly in spellbooks)

Possible to automate pulling some information from the frogcomposband source?

Speaking of which- move whole website over to latest FCB version since most
people play that.
- Update autogenerated HTML.
- CSS backlink bar for each page so you can escape spoiler pages

Guidelines:
100 character max line length
We want to keep the red/black/grey colour scheme
Push the use of html largely into CSS
